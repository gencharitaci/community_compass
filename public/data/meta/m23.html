<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Recycling reduces the amount of solid waste that is sent to nearby landfills and turns materials that would otherwise become waste into valuable resources and new products. In the process, recycling saves money for families and communities, saves energy and water, reduces air and water pollution, and conserves natural resources. Working together to increase recycling activity in a neighborhood can also promote community building and participation in neighborhood events.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>Residential recycling has remained relatively flat over time in Mecklenburg County, with only a significant increase in 2010 when single stream recycling was introduced. Since 2010, per capita recycling has remained between 0.38 and 0.44 pounds per day (140 to 160 pounds per year). Mecklenburg County has a relatively robust recycling program as nearly two-thirds of the County&#39;s residents participate in municipal recycling programs. The rate of recycling has steadily increased from 50.7% in 2013 to 65.1% in 2021. Unfortunately, many larger apartment and condominium buildings do not provide recycling services to residents as it is not required by law.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Every hour, we throw away 2.5 million plastic bottles. Americans throw enough aluminum away every three months to completely rebuild our entire commercial air fleet. Recycling saves 25-30% of the energy used to make glass from virgin materials. The steel industry recycles nearly 19 billion steel cans into new products each year. Recycling one ton of paper saves 17 trees.  One tree can filter up to 60 pounds of pollutants from the air each year. Americans receive 4.5 million tons of junk mail each year.  100 million trees are ground up each year to produce junk mail.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The number of households that participated in the City of Charlotte&#39;s curbside recycling program at least once per quarter for the fiscal year (July-June), divided by the total number of eligible households.</p>
<p>Recycling participation is determined by sensors affixed to residential roll out bins. The data include single family residential units (attached and detached), multi-family buildings with fewer than 30 units, and any additional legacy multi-family buildings serviced by the City of Charlotte. Data from all multi-family communities is not included as many do not provide recycling services and private recycling companies that do serve larger communities are not required to report the recyclables they process. Towns in Mecklenburg County are not included because solid waste data are not collected at the neighborhood level.</p>
