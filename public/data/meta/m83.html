<p>﻿## Residential Demolitions
Concentration of residential demolitions</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Residential demolitions are an indicator of changes in housing stock. Demolitions can occur due to a structure not meeting minimum housing requirements, due to a change in property use, or due to a new owner intending on rebuilding a newer home.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>There were 265 residential demolitions in 2011 and 534 in 2020, an increase of 41.8%. The overall trend in the number of demolitions is increasing, however, the peak was in 2017 with 757 demolitions.</p>
<h4 id="did-you-know">Did you know?</h4>
<p>Commercial buildings often attract the most attention, but 70% of all buildings demolished in Mecklenburg County are homes. Residential demolition is driven by Charlotte’s growing demand for housing. In booming, close-in neighborhoods such as NoDa or South End, high land values and demand for high-density projects are driving much of the redevelopment.</p>
<p>According to the UNC Charlotte Urban Institute, about one third of the 15,000 recorded demolitions since 1999 could be matched to new construction permits at the same address: 65% of the time, single family homes are constructed on the same site, while 32% of the time, the land is used for townhomes, duplexes or other higher density residential. Only 3% of parcels are converted to commercial use.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Residential demolitions per 1,000 single-family units for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Multiple demolitions on one parcel are counted as one. Single family housing units includes single-family detached homes as well as duplexes, triplexes, and mobile homes. Duplexes and triplexes are counted as 2 and 3 units, respectively.</p>
