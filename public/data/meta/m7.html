<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The age of housing generally reflects the development history of the county - Charlotte&#39;s oldest neighborhoods are closer to the center city and may be nearly 100 years old, while new neighborhoods continue to be built across the county. A decrease in average age in an area may indicate in-fill or redevelopment in an older neighborhood, or large numbers of new houses constructed on previously undeveloped land.</p>
<p>The average housing age may also provide an indication of the condition or character of a neighborhood&#39;s housing stock. Typically, older houses need higher levels of repair and maintenance, but offer opportunities for affordable rehabilitation or renovation and investment. A group of older homes may have historic significance or be classified as a local or national historic district. A group of newer homes is more likely to be organized around private amenities such as common areas, playgrounds, or pools. Offering a diverse mix of housing in cost, age, size, style, amenities and neighborhood settings is important to meet the needs and preferences of all residents.</p>

<p>In 2021, the median age of houses in Mecklenburg County was 33 years, compared to 39 years in the United States. Fifty percent of single-family structures in Mecklenburg County were built after 1990. Data from the Americal Community Survey shows that housing age varies significantly across the U.S. Houses in New York are the oldest with a median age of 63 followe3d by Rhode Island (60), Massachusetts (59), Pennsylvania (57), and Connecticut (55). Conversely, states with the lowest median age of housing are in the Sunbelt.  Homes in Nevada are the newest averaging 26 years old followed by Arizona (30), Utah and Georgia (31), and North and South Carolina at 32.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The age of each single-family housing structure (year of data collection minus year structure built) is summed and divided by the total number of single-family housing structures.</p>
<p>Single-family includes single-family detached units, duplexes, triplexes, and mobile homes, though each structure is counted only once regardless of the number of units within it.</p>
