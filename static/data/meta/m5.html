<p>Concentration of housing units</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Housing density may provide an indication of the residential character and development pattern of a neighborhood. Lower housing density is typified by larger lots or more single-family units in a suburban development pattern, while higher density neighborhoods have smaller lots or more multi-family structures. Higher housing density in neighborhoods can support the availability of local retail options, schools, and transit, provide opportunities for active transportation through walking and biking, provide greater accessibility to jobs, and create opportunities for affordable housing. However, a mix of low- and high-density developments are needed to ensure diverse housing choices for a variety of preferences and needs.</p>
<p>Housing density is not directly comparable to density calculations used in zoning and land use planning because housing density at a neighborhood scale can include land that is not zoned for residential use. Some areas of low housing density represent areas that are preserved as park space or natural habitat, or are largely commercial or industrial.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>The number of housing units in Mecklenburg County increased from 396,593 in 2011 to 493,568 in 2021. Housing units and density will continue to rise as population and number of households increases. Increasing housing density in already-developed areas can help to accommodate growth without compromising open space and natural areas. More compact development paterns help increase housing choices, preserve open space, create new job centers, and control the cost of providing infrastructure by concentrating development in smaller areas.</p>

<p>In a 2014 report from Smart Growth America, the Charlotte metropolitan region was ranked as the 5th most sprawling large metro area in the country. Sprawling development patterns are associated with a variety of adverse impacts including decline in sense of place and community connectedness, increased individual and household costs, reduced economic opportunity, and diminished environmental quality.</p>
