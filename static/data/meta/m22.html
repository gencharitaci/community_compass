<p>School-age child care programs support working families and can provide children with enrichment and academic opportunities that promote healthy development and school success. Proximity to care is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are program cost, availability of financial assistance, program capacity, hours of operation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.</p>
