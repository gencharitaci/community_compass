<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Early care and education programs support working families and provide young children with the strong foundation they need to enter school prepared to thrive. Substantial research demonstrates that accessible, high quality early care positively affects children&#39;s growth, physical health, cognitive, social and emotional development, and later school success. Proximity to care is only one aspect of accessibility. Other factors that affect access are program cost, availability of financial assistance, program capacity, hours of operation, and geographic barriers such as major highways.</p>
<h4 id="how-are-we-doing">How are we doing?</h4>
<p>In 2020, approximately 61% of housing units had proximity to early care and education. This is a slight decrease from 65% in 2015. While the number of child care centers has remained relatively constant over time, the number and capacity of family child care homes has declined steadily over the last five years.  In 2020, there were 540 licensed early childcare centers in Mecklenburg County.</p>
