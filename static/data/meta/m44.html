<h3 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Public transportation systems can provide affordable, safe and equitable access to work, home, education, food, health services, social activities and more. Public transportation usage, particularly as an alternative to driving, may also provide health benefits such as increasing physical activity, reduced pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, reduced fatalities and injuries, and greater social cohesion.  </p>
<p>Transit ridership can be impacted by a variety of factors. These factors include: bus stop location, frequency and hours of service, ridership cost, traffic congestion, fuel cost/availability, parking availability, employment rates, and more.</p>
